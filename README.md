# Text-Recognition-Model
A robust text recognition system leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks for sequence modeling. Enhanced with Tesseract OCR for precise text extraction, the model excels in recognizing and interpreting textual data from complex image inputs.
